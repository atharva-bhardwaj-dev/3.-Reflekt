# Reflekt (WIP)

Reflekt is an early-stage experimental framework exploring autonomous self-correction in LLMs through internal feedback loops and role-switching agents.

Inspired by techniques like Reflexion, Constitutional AI, and multi-agent prompting, Reflekt enables large language models to critique, revise, and finalize their own outputs — mimicking human-like introspection and iterative reasoning.

The core objective is to move beyond one-shot prompting toward systems that reflect, adapt, and improve over time. Reflekt treats prompting as a dynamic architecture, not just an instruction — enabling cognitive-style processing within and across agent roles.

Currently under active prototyping with Python, GPT-4, and LangChain, Reflekt is being developed at *The Insight Foundry* as part of an open e
